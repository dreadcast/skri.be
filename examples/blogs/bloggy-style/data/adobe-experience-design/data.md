# Adobe Experience Design CC

![Adobe Experience Design](/adobe-experience-design/xd.jpg)

Adobe just released yesterday its [Sketch](http://sketchapp.com) killer app: Experience Design, formerly known as *Comet*. It’s been while we hear about this old story, often delayed. But this time, it’s here for real!

## No, wait a moment!

What’s this *preview* all about? Preview stands for kinda-beta-pre-release, so don’t expect a fully loaded Holy Grail of UI and UX design. Advanced graphics will still require the use of Photoshop or Illustrator and interactions are just navigational transitions between each screens.

## Killer app?

I don’t really know what to expect from Sketch in a close future, but from what I’ve played with XD, they still lead the game in the field of graphic (web)design. Then InVision or Marvel are required to create interactive prototypes.

So, what makes XD interesting? In its state, in a production workflow, it will be quite painful to release prototypes with recurrent updates. Just imagine a prototype with 50 or more screens where typographic styles have to be changed from dark grey to darker grey. Think about changing the header logo on every screens. And so on…

No, XD will help you to create advanced, interactive wireframes, check the navigation tree, etc. You’ll be able to easily repeat a component, just like a pattern, by resizing a container and dropping a directory of thumbnails. It will surely help you to make good looking prototypes, providing that upstream assets are validated…

## What would make it THE prototype app?

The first thing that came to my mind was the lack of outlining, just like, yeah, Sketch. Or like Photoshop’s layers panel. This feature is not a gadget, it is essential in order to keep your layout organised and to make sure which element belongs to whom.

### Design features

At this point, graphic design consists in basic vector drawings, but forget about background images, gradient or drop shadows.

But does XD really need this? Not that sure! Just like with InDesign or its brothers, just let us link assets from `.psd` or `.ai` sources so that they automatically update in XD when edited where they belong. This would be a great feature.

Another thing: styles and guidelines. Several tools are emerging from competitors, [Component Hub](http://componenthub.io/) or [Craft](http://www.invisionapp.com/craft) just to name them. Wouldn’t a built-in equivalent more reliable?

### Interactivity

I’m pretty sure that Adobe will soon propose more interactivity than simple transitions. We need scrollers, hovers and other, more advanced effects, like transforms (rotate, scale, translate…).

User interface, user experience and interactive design is, although a niche, still an uncertain battlefield where software editors have margins to produce even more useful tools. Why not imagining such an app that will finally let you export ready-to-use graphical assets, CSS styles and React components with, say, Git support or any other versioning tool?
